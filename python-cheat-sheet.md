# Variables

Variables allow you to store data into a value for reuse, such as a date or user ID\

Variables can be declared with a =

Example:

```
myVariable = "Hello!"


print(myVariable)
```

They can be updated throughout your code

Example:

```
myVariable = "Hello!"

print(myVariable)

my variable = "Goodbye!"

print(myVariable)
```

# Numbers

Python has multiple ways of storing numbers:

An ```integer``` is a whole number: 9\
A ```point``` is a decimal number: 1.8\

```
thisIsAnInteger = 8\
thisIsAFloat = 4.1\
```


#Calculations

Python can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division:
```
+ - * /
```

Example:

```
print(500 - 50 + 1 * 2)
```

You can also perform calculations with stored data in variables:

```
price_of_bananas = 0.49
bananas_in_bunch = 5

print(price_of_bananas + bananas_in_bunch)
```
